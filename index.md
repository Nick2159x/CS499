## Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering

#### Artifact One Narrative
   
   The artifact that I choose to enhance is called weather_station.py. This programs’ objective is to record the temperature and humidity of the environment then store that information in a JSON file. This file was created as the final project of CS-350 class. I selected this artifact because I really enjoyed CS350 and I felt like this project was really fun to work on. The components that showcase my skills are programming the sensors to take a reading only when it is light outside and then storing it in a JSON file. This program has multiple if statements and loops. The improvements I included in this artifact was adding a feature that converts the JSON file into a csv format and then emails that file to a specific person. I think I met the course objectives that I planned for in this enhancement. I was able to send an email through the raspberry pi and have it as a CSV file. When enhancing this artifact, I learned some important ways to convert JSON files. I learned how to implement an emailing system in my raspberry pi and how to utilize it with a button click. The biggest challenge I had was getting the file to convert and be attached to the email. This was hard to figure out and also getting the update csv file with new information. Overall, I learned how to implement these new systems to enhance my artifact. 


## Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures

#### Artifact Two Narrative

   The artifact is call operand.cpp and it was first created in the CS405 secure coding class. This was created to show the vulnerability of not having ID numbers printed the same time every time and we changed it to randomize the output of ID numbers. I feel like this artifact is great in my portfolio because it demonstrates my ability to have different algorithms and data structures, while also focusing on the secure coding aspect of it. The array that stores the user data is the more efficient data structure compared to a vector, which shows my ability of making decisions for efficiency on memory. I chose a switch statement instead of an if-else statement because it is faster and if I were to create a large amount of case statements it would handle it better. The choices I made have created this program to be the most efficient in terms of data structures and algorithms. I think I have met the course objectives when I chose my enhancement for this artifact. Looking back on how I came up with enhancing this artifact, I really learned how to take a step back and try to pick and choose my data structures and algorithms that would be the best fit and the most efficient. I learned to look and think on how my code would affect memory and the overall speed of the program. I also learned how to create secure code. The hardest challenges that I had were figuring out the best data structures and algorithms to include in my enhancement.

## Enhancement Three: Databases

#### Artifact Three Narrative

   The artifact I chose to enhance was Milestone2 from CS340 and it was the introduction to a Restful API and Bottle framework. I included this artifact in my ePortfolio because it showcased my knowledge in databases, APIs, and Python programming language. I thought this artifact would be interesting to make it in my own way. That is where the enhancement comes in. For my enhancement I choose to create a brand-new database called “NicksZoo” and have a collection named “Animals”. I stored a bunch of zoo animals in it with their names and type of animal they are. Then I utilized the restful API to allow for users on the client side to create new animals, read all the animals, update animals, and delete animals, by using specific URL routes. Looking back at this program, I can say that I did meet the course objectives that I planned to meet and that my outcome for having a fully functional restful API is complete. When creating this program, I learned a great deal about MongoDB and how to create local instance of the database server on your computer and how to connect to it. I learned how to problem solve and find the best routes and functions to achieve my goal of creating a Restful API with CRUD functionality. I improved my Python skills even further than before I started this program. I really had a hard time with setting up the MongoDB. I had to figure out the right configurations for security so my computer could start it. I also had a hard time writing the correct routes and functions to perform the queries on the MongoDB.
