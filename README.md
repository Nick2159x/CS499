# Software Engineering e-Portfolio

## Profressional Self Assessment
Throughout my time at Southern New Hampshire University pursuing my degree in computer science with a concentration in software engineering, I was able to gain knowledge of a wide number of skills, which include different programming languages, different aspects of computer hardware and software, and the different stages of the software development life cycle. Throughout this program I was able to showcase my knowledge of the different programming languages, such as C++, Python, and Java, as well as my skills in database management using SQL and MongoDB. Using all the skills I received from this program has prepared me for my future career in software engineering.

When it comes to working in a team environment and collaborating of projects, CS310 offer an introduction to working in a team environment and taught me skills on how to proficiently work on a project as a team. Communicating with stakeholders was present in almost every final project in a computer science course, but it was really broken down in CS250, which was software development life cycle. This course taught me the skills I need to communicate with the stakeholders and fulfill the needs they required. I learned the process on developing a program and the different steps, which are key to efficiently and properly develop this program.
This program has gone hand and hand with my current career as an applications analyst. I have used the skills that I learned at Southern New Hampshire University and used them in a real-world environment. I have worked in a team environment and communicated directly with stakeholders on multiple projects. One thing I have learned is a project is never really finished, there is always something that needs to be added or fixed. My experience working with real customers is having an actual deadline and budget to deal with, which you do not really experience in the school environment. This has taught me to manage my time more efficiently to complete the project with the stakeholder in mind.

Coming out of school and going into the real-world environment was an eye opener. Using the what I learned about data structures and algorithms, I was able to succeed in my early-on projects in my career. After school it is up to you to retain that knowledge and learn more about data structures and algorithms. My current job is to handle developing new application and to be the DBA for our databases. I am using all the skills I learned about software engineering and design for the application development and using what I learned about databases for the database management. 

The three artifacts that are included for this portfolio, were all pieces that showcased my skills in software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. My first artifact showcased my enjoyment of programming with the Raspberry Pi. The second artifact showcases my skill in C++ and data structure and algorithms and making sure my code is secure. The third artifact showcased my skills with databases as well as creating APIs.
